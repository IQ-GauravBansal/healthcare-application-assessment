1.Automation:
Lab: Automate a simple deployment script using a tool of your choice (e.g., Bash, Python). Provide the script and its output.

2.Security:
Lab: Configure a security group in AWS that only allows SSH and HTTP access. Provide the security group ID and its rules.

We will create a Security Group that allows only port 22 for SSH and port 80 for HTTP access in AWS.

3.Incident Response:
Lab: Simulate a simple incident (e.g., service down) and provide a step-by-step log of your incident response actions.

For Service down, check the error.
Try to figure out th error and reason of error.
Find out the flow of error occuring and the root cause of the error.

For example, If there is service down of endpoint URL due to exceeded limit of users.
In that case, increase the Computing Power, enable Autoscaling, either Horizontal or Vertical.
