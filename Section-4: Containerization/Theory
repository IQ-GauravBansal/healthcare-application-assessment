Theory: Write a Dockerfile for a Node.js application that installs dependencies, copies the application code, and starts the application using npm start.

DockerFile
FROM node:alpine-latest
RUN mkdir /healthcare
WORKDIR /healthcare

COPY package.json /healthcare
RUN npm install

COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["npm", "start", "daemon off"]
