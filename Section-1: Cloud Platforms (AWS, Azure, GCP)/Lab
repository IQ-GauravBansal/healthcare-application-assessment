Lab: Create and configure an S3 bucket with public read access. Upload a file to the bucket and provide the URL for access.

We have created an AWS IAM User with Read Only Access to the S3 Bucket. 

We have attached the following Bucket policy to the IAM User-
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*",
                "s3:Describe*",
                "s3-object-lambda:Get*",
                "s3-object-lambda:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
