Lab: Create and configure an S3 bucket with public read access. Upload a file to the bucket and provide the URL for access.

We have created an AWS IAM User with Read Only Access to the S3 Bucket. 

We have attached the following Bucket policy to the IAM User-
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*",
                "s3:Describe*",
                "s3-object-lambda:Get*",
                "s3-object-lambda:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

After the IAM User is created, we have created Access Credentials for the IAM User-

Access Key- AKIAQEFWAHXQ2CULKONP
Secret Access Key- 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

After that, we have created S3 bucket in AWS.
We have created two Folders inside the bucket for different purposes.
