Lab: Set up a build pipeline in Azure DevOps that clones a Git repository, builds a simple Java application, and archives the build artifacts. Provide the URL of the Azure DevOps pipeline.

1.We will setup code on  Git or GitHub Repositories using Git Bash or VS Code.
2.After the code is available on Github, we will start the process of deployment.
3.We can attach the Azure Pipelines directly to the GitHub or Git Repository on Azure Repositories.
4.First, we create a Resource Group.
5.In Resource Group, we have Azure Pipelines and different stages in Pipeline.
6.In Pipelines, we setup Cloud Build using Yaml file.
7.The Artifacts are stored in Azure Artifacts.
8.There is Testing stage in Pipelines
9.There is Releases section.
